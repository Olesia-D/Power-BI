## Key Findings
**Overall Conclusion:** Promotions are most effective on Mondays (the profit more than doubled) and in type A stores (+231.39 million). 
        They not only attract more customers but also increase the average check (e.g., from 8.38 to 10.36 on Mondays).  

**Business Perspective (Is it worth investing in promotions?):**  
        Promotions are effective: they boost sales across days and store types.  
        The average check increases with promotions, meaning they not only draw more customers but also raise spending per customer. This is a positive signal for the business.  
        However, in stores of type B, the introduction of promotions actually decreases sales. Nevertheless, if we look at the store revenue metrics by day, we can see that this type of store generates 83% of its         revenue on Sundays. This indicates that type B stores are primarily focused on Sunday operations.
        Given the context that most stores in Germany are closed on Sundays, we can conclude that type B stores are mostly located at train stations and cater to customers who need to make urgent purchases.               Therefore, introducing promotions in these stores is not reasonable—customers will buy what they urgently need regardless of any discounts.

 Additionally, when analyzing the revenue from assortment B separately, we can see that it is sold exclusively in type B stores, with the highest revenue generated on Sundays. Therefore, there is no need          to introduce promotions for this product category either.

**Optimization (When/Where to run promotions?):**  
        **When:** The best days for promotions are Monday and Tuesday, where the impact is strongest. 
          On Thursday and Friday, the effect is lower, so promotions could be less frequent there.
          According to the data, promotions are not applied on Saturdays. It is recommended to test the introduction of promotions on this day, as the data shows that Saturday already generates the highest                  revenue of the week, even without any promotions. This revenue could potentially increase further if promotions are implemented. 
        **Where:** Focus on type A stores, where the effect is most significant. 
          For type B stores, it’s worth testing alternative strategies, as standard promotions are less effective.
